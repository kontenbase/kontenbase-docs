This is Kontenbase v2, not much different from the v1 but come back with many more simple and easy ways to help developers during website app development!

Kontenbase is a low code-no code platform that allows you to create:
- Auto generated Backend API
- Object storage to organize your files and assets
- Built in basic authentication like role management without coding
- Real-time support with battle tested performance

# Kontenbase Account
To log in to Kontenbase, Kontenbase Users need to log in with GitHub Account. GitHub as code management is used to store the need for custom code in Kontenbase, Function.

You can also directly connect your existing project to your GitHub and adjust the data model in Kontenbase. So, it is easy to use and does not much time needed to re-create your project in Kontenbase.

# Organization
Organizations are a way to group your projects. Each organization can be configured with different team members and billing settings.

Here, you can see a list of applications that you and your teams are currently developing or add new projects that you are about to develop.

## Team Members 
You can invite your team members into your organizations to collaborate on projects.
